Playlist Continuation Hybrid Recommendation Engine

Welcome to the repository for the Playlist Continuation Hybrid Recommendation Engine. This project leverages a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and context-aware recommendations to enhance the music listening experience by automatically suggesting tracks that align with user preferences and playlist themes

Introduction

In the age of digital music streaming, the way people discover and enjoy music has evolved significantly. This project aims to address the challenges of music recommendation systems by developing a hybrid model that enhances user experience through sophisticated playlist continuation techniques. Using the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset, our system intelligently appends tracks to playlists, balancing user familiarity with musical diversity to create a coherent and engaging listening experience.

Features

Hybrid Recommendation Approach: Combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and context-aware techniques to recommend music.
User Interaction Analysis: Utilizes extensive user interaction data to refine recommendations.
Machine Learning Integration: Employs advanced machine learning algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks, XGBoost, and Alternating Least Squares.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses recommendation quality using precision, recall, and user satisfaction metrics.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset. The primary columns in the dataset are:

'userid': Unique identifier for each user.
'artistname': Name of the artist.
'trackname': Name of the track.
'playlistname': Name of the playlist.

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playlist-continuation-recommender.git
cd playlist-continuation-recommender
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Unzip the dataset:

bash
Copy code
unzip playlist.csv.zip

Usage

Prepare the Dataset:
Ensure the playlist.csv is in the root directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open Playlist Continuation Hybrid Recommendation System.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Execute the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the models.
Generate Recommendations:
Follow the instructions in the notebook to generate music recommendations based on user input or predefined playlists.

Methodology

The recommendation engine utilizes a hybrid approach, combining multiple techniques to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems:

Collaborative Filtering: Leverages user-item interactions to recommend tracks that similar users have enjoyed.
Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes track features such as artist and genre to suggest similar songs.
Context-Aware Recommendations: Considers contextual variables to enhance the relevance of recommendations.
The machine learning models employed include:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): For deep learning-based pattern recognition.
XGBoost: A gradient boosting algorithm for handling structured data.
Alternating Least Squares (ALS): For matrix factorization in collaborative filtering.
Evaluation

The effectiveness of the recommendation system is evaluated using the following metrics:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of the recommended tracks.
Recall: Measures the ability to cover all relevant tracks in recommendations.
User Satisfaction: Assesses how well the recommendations meet user preferences.

Results

The hybrid recommendation system significantly improves playlist coherence and user satisfaction compared to traditional models. The combination of different recommendation strategies ensures a more personalized and enjoyable music listening experience.

Future Work

Future enhancements could include:

Advanced Algorithms: Integration of more sophisticated machine learning models.
Additional Contextual Factors: Exploring more variables to refine the recommendation quality.
Real-time Recommendations: Enhancing the system to provide instant recommendations based on real-time user interactions.
